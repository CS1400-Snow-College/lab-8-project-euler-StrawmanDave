1.(Multiples of 3 or 5) 
This program will take a number you give it find all the multiples of 4 and 3 then add them together and return the sum.

2.(Largest Prime factor)
This progarm will find the factors of a number you give it. Then it will elimnate the non-prime numbers. Then it will return the largest one.

3.(Sum Squar Difference)
This program takes in 2 numbers and squares each number up to both numbers and adds them. Then it subtracts each sum and returns the value.

4.(10001st Prime)
This program takes a number and spits out the number nth prime that you gave it.
